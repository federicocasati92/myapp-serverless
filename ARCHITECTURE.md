# 🧩 AWS Serverless Architecture Overview

This provides a structured overview of your AWS serverless project.

## 📁 Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting

- **Bucket Name:** stsite3.com  
- **Public Access Enabled:** Yes  
- **Index Document:** `index.html`  
- **Endpoint URL:** `http://stsite3.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

**Security Notes:**  
- Bucket is public to allow static website hosting via CloudFront.
- Access is limited to **read-only (GetObject)** operations — no write, delete, or list permissions are granted.

  Current bucket policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",

## 📌 Notes

- This architecture was built and configured **entirely via AWS Console** (manual deployment).
- Public access and shared test credentials are intentional for demo/testing purposes.
- For a production setup, it is recommended to:
  - Implement least-privilege IAM policies
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Enable HTTPS-only CloudFront
  - Integrate Secrets Manager for credential handling
